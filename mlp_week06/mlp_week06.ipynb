Dummy variables are variables that take binary (True=1, False=0) assignments based on every category in a given column. For example, our categories are Setosa, Virginica and Versicolor. We will have a column for each of these species and will assign a 1 or 0 for each row depending on what species they are. So a sample row representing Setosa, will have the Setosa column value of 1 and the Virginica and Versicolor values would be assigned as 0."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"cell_id":"8f72f70f4c984a64a3b27a0307c7badc","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"deepnote_cell_type":"code","id":"VcuBnGPavZ73","outputId":"6e1a6cad-acb2-454e-ea14-4e1753f4d69e","output_cleared":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# Consider species_label function as a helper \n","# For iris data example \n","def species_label(theta):\n","\tif theta==0:\n","\t\treturn raw_data.target_names[0]\n","\tif theta==1:\n","\t\treturn raw_data.target_names[1]\n","\tif theta==2:\n","\t\treturn raw_data.target_names[2]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"cell_id":"ae8dee28877b4e9a82b92a11d02b38c2","deepnote_cell_type":"code"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["   sepal length (cm)  sepal width (cm)  petal length (cm)  petal width (cm)  \\\n","0                5.1               3.5                1.4               0.2   \n","1                4.9               3.0                1.4               0.2   \n","2                4.7               3.2                1.3               0.2   \n","3                4.6               3.1                1.5               0.2   \n","4                5.0               3.6                1.4               0.2   \n","\n","  species  \n","0  setosa  \n","1  setosa  \n","2  setosa  \n","3  setosa  \n","4  setosa  \n","setosa        50\n","versicolor    50\n","virginica     50\n","Name: species, dtype: int64\n"]}],"source":["# data = pd.DataFrame(raw_data.data, columns=raw_data.feature_names)\n","data['species'] = [species_label(theta) for theta in raw_data.target]\n","#data['species_id'] = raw_data.target\n","print(data.head())\n","\n","# Class size information\n","print(data.species.value_counts())"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"cell_id":"0e0127b394cd40e196613f02b13fb3ae","deepnote_cell_type":"code","id":"WEq_asGw5d7M"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["0      0\n","1      0\n","2      0\n","3      0\n","4      0\n","      ..\n","145    2\n","146    2\n","147    2\n","148    2\n","149    2\n","Name: species, Length: 150, dtype: int8\n","   sepal length (cm)  sepal width (cm)  petal length (cm)  petal width (cm)\n","0                5.1               3.5                1.4               0.2\n","1                4.9               3.0                1.4               0.2\n","2                4.7               3.2                1.3               0.2\n","3                4.6               3.1                1.5               0.2\n","4                5.0               3.6                1.4               0.2\n","0    0\n","1    0\n","2    0\n","3    0\n","4    0\n","Name: species, dtype: int8\n"]}],"source":["#Prepare the data set\n","\n","#Encoding Species columns (to numerical values)\n","data['species'] = data['species'].astype('category').cat.codes\n","print(data['species'])\n","\n","#Feature & Target Selection\n","# X = feature values, all the columns except the last column\n","X = data.iloc[:, :-1]\n","print(X.head())\n","\n","# y = target values, last column of the data frame\n","y = data.iloc[:, -1]\n","print(y.head())"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"01e7503da1244731b2551d279ae291db","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","id":"eJZMp0E13sbM"},"source":["After partitioning your data set into training and testing with %80-%20 rule,\n","\n","- Create `One-Vs-Rest Logistic` Regression pipeline and train your model\n","- Create `Multinomial Logistic` Regression pipeline and train your model"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"3283b235af0c4dde95676156c7180f15","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","id":"9Ow2uUjn-5H9"},"source":["Under this method/strategy a multi-class classification dataset (in our case IRIS) is split into multiple binary classification chunks/datasets.
